./components/product/ProductCardOne.tsx
43:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'minifyProduct?.color'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.

./components/shipping/AddressBar.tsx
456:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'waitForSuccess'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/swiper/Swiper.tsx
125:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'intevalForward'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
