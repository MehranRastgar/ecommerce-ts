./pages/checkout/cart.tsx
103:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'calcSum'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./pages/client/login.tsx
118:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'errorMessage.length', 'returnUrl', and 'router.query.returnUrl'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./pages/search/brand/[brand].tsx
48:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router.query.page'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

48:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router.query.page'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./pages/search/category/[category].tsx
48:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router.query.page'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./pages/search/index.tsx
46:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router.query.page'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
136:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'changeState'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/headers/navbarMobile.tsx
55:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'dispatch' and 'settingState'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/headers/navbarOne.tsx
38:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'dispatch' and 'settingState'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/Layout.tsx
89:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'config' and 'configPage'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
136:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'dispatch'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'isMobile' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
157:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'router.events'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/product/ProductCardOne.tsx
43:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'minifyProduct?.color'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. If 'setColorState' needs the current value of 'minifyProduct.color', you can also switch to useReducer instead of useState and read 'minifyProduct.color' in the reducer.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/ProductPage/ProductInfoSection.tsx
44:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'autoVariantSelection'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
147:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'handleClickShape'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/products/ProductSliderOne.tsx
164:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'minifyProduct?.color'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. If 'setColorState' needs the current value of 'minifyProduct.color', you can also switch to useReducer instead of useState and read 'minifyProduct.color' in the reducer.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/shipping/AddressBar.tsx
445:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'waitForSuccess'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/swiper/Swiper.tsx
125:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'intevalForward'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
